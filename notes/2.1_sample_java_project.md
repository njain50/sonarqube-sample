- addded some sample java code manaully here .\sonarqube-sample\sample-java-project

it contains java code : sample-java-project/src/com/nitin/sonarqube/FirstSonarJava.java
and property file:  sample-java-project/sonar-project.properties

basic requirement for sonar-project.properties file:
-------------------------------------------
Setup following properties
◦ sonar.projectKey
◦ sonar.projectName
◦ sonar.projectVersion
-------------------------------------------

- we have defined 'sonar.language=java' in property file so that sonarqube will know it need to apply java rules for this project.
- These java rules are built-in rules that come with installation of sonarqube via default plugins.
- https://rules.sonarsource.com/java  => 612 rules for Java
- these rules are classified into vulnerabilities, bugs, security hotspots and Code smells. 
- we can also customize these rules at our end. 

scanner will run as per following diagram: notes/2.1_scanner-run.png
sonar-server running on port 9000
small code base
and sonar-scanner.properties added 

scanner is a standalone program which scans  code base based on language we have configured and submit results to sonarqube server.
Developers can have standalone scanner or they can integradte with other build tools as well. 

lets run it:

Report is available here: http://localhost:9000/dashboard?id=sample-java-project
Also we can capture report via api here: http://localhost:9000/api/ce/task?id=AXYL6FQkRL55wrRRoo80

Both links are part of scanner output.

While reviewing the report, we can go to project => issues and review each issue to take required action accordingly. 
we can change issue status from Open to Following:
**Confirmed**:this issue has been reviewed and something should be done eventually to fix it.
**Resolved as fixed**: this has been fixed in code and is waiting for next analysis to close it or reopen if it was actually not fixed.
                       If code is not fixed then issue will be reopened automatically. 
**Resolved as false positive**:this can be ignored as its due to limitatino of analysis engine. Its effort wont be counted. 
**Resolve as won't fix**: This issue can be ignored as effort wont be counted in effor and it can be ignored

Under "Resolution" and "Status" side panel we can review how many issues fixed, remvoed, won't fix etc. 

we can make fixes to code and rerun the report and updated results will be reflected at sonarqube.
